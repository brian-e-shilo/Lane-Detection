**Lane Detection Project**

**Overview**

This project involves the development of a lane detection system for autonomous vehicles or driver assistance systems. The goal is to detect lane markings on the road using computer vision techniques, providing real-time feedback for vehicle navigation.

**Features**

- **Real-time Lane Detection:** Identifies lane markings in video streams.
- **Curved and Straight Lane Handling:** Capable of detecting both straight and curved lanes.
- **Robustness to Lighting Conditions:** Performs well in various lighting conditions, including shadows and low light.
- **Lane Departure Warning:** Alerts when the vehicle is veering out of the detected lanes.

**Acknowledgments**

- This project was inspired by various open-source lane detection projects and research papers.
- Special thanks to contributors and the open-source community.
